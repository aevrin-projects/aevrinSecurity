# Agent guide: coverage-analysis

Plugin: testing-skills (Code Auditing)
Skill folder: plugins/code-auditing/testing-skills/skills/coverage-analysis/

This file tells a coding agent how to work in this skill folder. For general rules and the agent-neutral term table, read the root AGENTS.md first. For user-facing examples, see USAGE.md.

## Purpose

Measures and interprets what a fuzzing campaign actually reaches, using llvm-cov, lcov, or a fuzzer's own coverage output. Covers baselining a new campaign, reading coverage reports, and turning uncovered regions into harness, seed, or dictionary work. Use when a fuzzer plateaus, when judging whether a harness is effective, after changing a harness, or when asking why some code is never reached.

## How to start

1. Open `SKILL.md` in this folder and read it fully before you act.
2. Follow its steps in order. Do not skip steps or checks.
3. Load a file from the table below only when `SKILL.md` or a loaded file points to it.
4. Write results where `SKILL.md` says. If it does not say, write to `./reports/` and tell the user the path.
5. Do not change the target code unless the user asked for a fix.

## Files in this folder

| File | What it is | When to load it |
|---|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Measures and interprets what a fuzzing campaign actually reaches, using llvm-cov, lcov, or a fuzzer's own coverage output. Covers baselining a new campaign, reading coverage reports, and turning uncovered regions into harness,... | First. Always. |

## Example requests

- Use: Use plugins/code-auditing/testing-skills/skills/coverage-analysis/SKILL.md. Task: <describe what you want>. Target: this repository.
- Save the output: Use plugins/code-auditing/testing-skills/skills/coverage-analysis/SKILL.md on this repository. Write the result and the evidence to ./reports/coverage-analysis.md.

## Rules for this skill

- Report only what you can show with evidence from the code or tool output.
- Say clearly when something is a guess or could not be checked.
- Keep each finding tied to a file and a line.
- Never run code from the target project outside a sandbox.
- If a step needs a tool you do not have, say so and use the fallback in the root AGENTS.md.
